The hERG channel is a voltage-gated potassium channel involved in the electrical 
activity of the heart. The inhibition of the hERG channel leads to a high risk of cardio 
toxicology and thus has become a critical issue in the pharmaceutical industry. In recent 
years, computational molecular models have accelerated the drug discovery process, but 
they have not been able to solve the binding modes of hERG blockers. This study aims 
to understand and predict how small molecules interfere with the channel, and its 
promiscuity to bind with a wide range of drugs. To predict if an unknown molecule can 
be a potential drug candidate and thus is not an hERG inhibitor, we have built several 
QSAR models applying the Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Light-GBM algorithms. 
The obtained models were externally validated using a “One-Cluster-Out Cross
Validation” strategy specifically developed to assess the predictive ability of the model 
in a closer real-world scenario. Furthermore, using structure-based drug design a 
docking study was conducted to gain insight into the binding modes of the hERG 
inhibitors. The developed QSAR models have showed good prediction accuracy 
(balanced accuracy exceeding 70%) for the Random Forest and Light-GBM models. 
However, only the Light-GBM model maintains a low % of error (under 10%) in the 
classification of the external validation data. Additionally, four binding modes of hERG 
inhibitors were discovered. All uncovered binding modes highlight the fundamental role 
of tyrosines (Y652) in the stabilization and binding of the drugs in the central cavity of 
the protein, which has been previously characterized by several studies. Nonetheless, 
several other amino acid residues, such as the alanines (A653), the serines (S660 and 
S624), and the glycines (G657), were observed to be responsible for key interactions in 
the binding modes.
